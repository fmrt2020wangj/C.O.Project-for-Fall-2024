Below is a brief description of each lab within the C.O.Project:
.TP
.B Lab0
C Warm-Up & Preview \- Introduces the C programming language and provides a preview of the project.
.TP
.B Lab1
Write an assembler for the LC-3b Assembly Language \- Develops an assembler that can compile LC-3b assembly code.
.TP
.B Lab2
Write an instruction-level simulator \- Creates a simulator that operates at the instruction level without cycle accuracy.
.TP
.B Lab3
Write a cycle-level simulator \- Advances to a simulator that models the CPU cycle by cycle.
.TP
.B Lab4
Write a cycle-level simulator supporting Interrupts and Exceptions \- Enhances the simulator to handle interrupts and exceptions.
